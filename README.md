## Usage

When the user navigates to the above URL, they are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. Once they click on the link to the notes page, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and text in the right-hand column.

From here, the user can enter a new note title and text. A save icon will appear in the navigation at the top of the page. Once the save icon is clicked, the user's note is saved and will appear in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.

If the user clicks an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column.

If the user clicks the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, they will be presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and text.
